Project proposal: Bangladesh Agriculture Revolution Software

Summary:
 The Bangladesh Agriculture Revolution Software aims to leverage technology to transform and modernize the agriculture sector in Bangladesh. This project will follow the software development life cycle (SDLC) to 
 ensure a systematic and efficient development process.

Objective:
  1.	Increase agriculture productivity through the implementation of modern technology.
  2.	Enhance farmers’ access to information and resources for improved decision making.
  3.	Streaming supply chain management to reduce post-harvest process.
  4.	Facilitate efficient data connection and analysis for informed policy making.
  5.	Foster collaboration among stakeholders in the agriculture ecosystem.

 Project Scope: 
 The project will include the development of a comprehensive software solution covering the following modules-
  1.	Farm Management System: Track and manage farm activities, crop rotations, and resource utilization.
  2.	Weather Forecast Integration: Provide Real-time weather updates and forecasts to help farmers plan their activities.
  3.	Market Integration: Connect farmers with buyers, streamlining with distribution and sale of agricultural products.
  4.	Data Analysis Dashboard: Analyze data to identify trends, predict crop yields, and make data-driven decision.
  5.	Mobile application: Enable access to key features on smartphones, ensuring widespread adoption.
